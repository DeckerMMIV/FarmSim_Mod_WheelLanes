# Farming Simulator modification - Wheel Lanes

## Intro

Make wheels destroy grown crops.

Destroy ALL fruits with foliage-layers that allows-seeding, from growth-state #3 and up.
However:
- Ignores "just seeded" and first visible growth (state #2.)
- Ignores "defoliaged".
- Does not kill grass/luzerne/alfalfa/clover, only reduce it to growth-state #2.
- Does not kill dryGrass, as it is basically only windrows anyway.
