Farming Simulator modification - Wheel Lanes
============================================
Make wheels destroy grown crops.

Destroy ALL fruits with foliage-layers that allows-seeding, disregarding whatever growth-state they are at.
However:
- Ignores "just seeded"
- Ignores "defoliaged"
- Does not kill grass, only reduce it to growth-state #1.
- Does not kill dryGrass, as it is basically only windrows anyway.
